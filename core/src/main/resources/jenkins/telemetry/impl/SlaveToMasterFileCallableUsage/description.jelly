    Jenkins controllers construct a remote-procedure-call (RPC) channel to agents to instruct them to perform work.
    This channel is bidirectional and in a handful of cases agents made requests of the controller.
    This was always tricky to secure,
    and <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2021-11-04/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently</a>
    the category of usages which involved access to files was more tightly restricted than before;
    Jenkins developers are considering disabling this kind of usage entirely.
    Since it is difficult to determine via static analysis or even manual code inspection which plugins are using this system,
    we are collecting information on how widely it is used.
    The data includes:
    <ul>
      <li>Java stack traces (names of Java classes mainly in Jenkins core and plugins as well as method names and line numbers) of file accesses on the controller from agents</li>
      <li>Version numbers of Jenkins core and all installed plugins</li>
    </ul>
    We do <em>not</em> collect the names of files being accessed or anything else not determined by versions of software components in use.
